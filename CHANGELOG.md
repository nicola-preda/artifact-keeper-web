## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **SSO admin UI: map SAML IdP groups to Artifact Keeper groups** (#588, backend artifact-keeper#2333 implemented in #2448) - the SAML provider form gains a **Map IdP groups to Artifact Keeper groups** switch on both create and edit, default off, mirroring the OIDC toggle from #534. With it on, the values of the assertion attribute named by `attribute_mapping.groups` (the **Groups Attribute** field on the same form) become Artifact Keeper group memberships at login: matching groups are auto-created for the provider, a group the provider did not create (including an operator-managed group of the same name) is never reused and that membership is refused instead per the backend's ownership guard, and membership is reconciled on every login, so removing a user from a group at the IdP removes the membership here. Off keeps the legacy role-mapping behavior. The flag is sent on `POST /api/v1/admin/sso/saml` and `PUT /api/v1/admin/sso/saml/{id}`, and round-trips through `SamlConfigResponse` so the edit dialog shows the provider's stored setting rather than resetting to the default. Backends predating the field are handled by a defensive `false` fallback in the SAML response adapter, matching the existing `use_absolute_acs_url` handling.
- **Repository deduplicated storage usage panel** (#593, backend epic artifact-keeper#2056) - the repository detail view gains a **Storage** panel that reports the real, dedup-aware footprint instead of only the coarse logical `storage_used_bytes`: logical vs physical bytes, dedup ratio and savings (bytes + %), a unique-vs-shared stacked bar, the `dedup_scope` label (`per_repo` / `instance`) with an inline caveat that instance-scope figures reflect blobs pooled across the whole instance, and `computed_at` freshness (hover for the exact timestamp). Admins additionally see the instance-wide `instance_unique_bytes` total and an on-demand **"reclaimable now"** estimate (a `storage-gc` dry-run — nothing is deleted). **Security (backend artifact-keeper#2560):** on `instance`-scope backends the backend omits `physical_bytes`/`unique_bytes`/`shared_bytes`/`dedup_ratio` for non-admin viewers, so the panel degrades gracefully — a non-admin on instance scope sees only logical size + blob count plus a note that the detailed breakdown is admin-only, and the descriptive shared-bytes copy + instance total + reclaimable estimate are gated on admin both server-side and in the UI. The per-repository endpoints are not in the generated SDK yet (v1.5.0 only ships the instance-wide `/admin/analytics/storage/breakdown` + `/admin/storage-gc`), so `src/lib/api/storage.ts` uses the shared `apiFetch` wrapper (same pattern as routing-rules / audit / downloads); if the endpoint is unavailable the panel falls back to the repository's logical `storage_used_bytes`. The folder / path-tree storage rollup (epic sub-task 4) is intentionally out of scope here.
- **CVE Blast-Radius view** (#570) - new `/security/blast-radius` admin page surfacing the blast-radius endpoints backend #2364 added (`GET /api/v1/admin/security/cve/{cve_id}/blast-radius`, `/security/artifact/{artifact_id}/blast-radius`): given a CVE/GHSA id or an artifact id, shows **who is exposed**. Summary tiles (affected artifacts, affected repos, distinct downloaders, distinct IPs, total downloads) plus an "Anonymous downloads present" badge; an **affected repositories** table that classifies each repo's reachability and loudly flags `access_scope=public` as "Public — everyone exposed" (vs. restricted-ACL / restricted-roles); and a paginated **downloaders** table (username or 'anonymous', download count, distinct-IP spread with a sample preview, first/last download) with server-side page/per_page pagination (default 20, max 100 per the backend cap). Target ids are validated client-side (CVE/GHSA format, artifact UUID) and CVE ids are normalized to canonical casing. Deep-linkable via `?cve=` / `?artifact=`, and scan-finding advisory cells on the scan detail page now carry a crosshair drill-in link to the report. New "Blast Radius" entry in the Security nav group. The endpoints are not in the generated SDK yet, so `src/lib/api/blast-radius.ts` uses the shared `apiFetch` wrapper with zod validation at the trust boundary (same pattern as audit and downloads); on a backend without the endpoints the page degrades to an "unavailable" alert.
- **Generic artifact version history UI** (#571) - surfaces the first-class versioning backend #2367 added for Generic/Mlmodel repositories (`GET /api/v1/repositories/{key}/versions/{path}`, `?version=<rev|label|latest>` on the download/metadata routes, and a per-repo `versioning_enabled` flag). In the repository artifact browser, the artifact detail dialog gains a **Versions** tab — a table of stored revisions (revision number with a "latest" badge, optional version label, size, short SHA-256 with copy, uploader when the backend provides it, and stored date) with a **per-revision download** that pins the exact stored bytes via `?version=<revision>` (composing a download ticket onto the version-selected URL). The tab only appears for repositories that opted into versioning AND whose format participates (Generic/Mlmodel); an artifact with no recorded history renders a quiet empty state and the normal single-artifact download is unchanged, so existing (non-versioned) repos are unaffected. The repository **Settings** tab gains an **Artifact Versioning** section with an "Enable versioning" toggle (Generic/Mlmodel only) that writes `versioning_enabled` through the existing update-repository endpoint. The endpoints are not in the generated SDK yet, so `src/lib/api/versions.ts` uses the shared `apiFetch` wrapper with zod validation at the trust boundary (same pattern as audit/downloads), normalizes the backend's 404-on-no-history to an empty list, and `repositoriesApi` reads/writes `versioning_enabled` through a narrowed cast until the SDK regenerates. New `ArtifactVersionsPage` e2e page object + `artifact-version-history.spec.ts` (API contract: newest-first list, `?version=` pins old bytes, `versioning_enabled` round-trip; best-effort admin UI checks), and a `versioning_enabled: true` generic repo seeded for the e2e stack. **Backend gap:** the `/versions` response does not serialize `uploaded_by` yet (the column exists on `artifact_versions`), so the uploader column stays hidden until the backend adds it — the UI plumbs the field through defensively.
- **Download Attribution & Network-Topology dashboard** (#569) - new `/downloads` admin page surfacing the download-attribution endpoints backend #2365 added (`GET /api/v1/admin/downloads`, `/downloads/by-ip/{ip}`, `/downloads/by-user/{user_id}`). Three views over attributed download events: **Events** (paginated table of time, user — 'anonymous' when unauthenticated, client IP, artifact, user agent), **By IP / Subnet** (network-topology grouping: downloads, unique users, unique artifacts, and last activity per client IP with its /24 or /64 subnet), and **By User** (per-user activity with unique-IP spread). Grouped views aggregate client-side over the most recent matching events (the backend returns rows, not aggregates) and note when the sample is truncated; each group row drills back into the filtered Events view. Filters: artifact id and user id (UUID-validated client-side), exact client IP, and an inclusive date range, plus server-side page/per_page pagination (default 20, max 100 per the backend cap). An exclusive IP or user filter is routed through the dedicated by-ip/by-user endpoint. New "Downloads" entry in the Operations nav group. The endpoints are not in the generated SDK yet, so `src/lib/api/downloads.ts` uses the shared `apiFetch` wrapper with zod validation at the trust boundary (same pattern as rate-limits and audit); on a backend without the endpoints the page degrades to an "unavailable" alert.
- **Admin Audit Log viewer** (#568) - new `/audit` admin page surfacing the backend audit-log query endpoint (`GET /api/v1/admin/audit`, backend #2366). Table of recorded events (time, actor, action, resource, IP, details) with filters for action, resource type, acting user id (UUID-validated client-side), and an inclusive date range, plus server-side page/per_page pagination (default 50, max 200 per the backend cap). Actor user ids are resolved to usernames client-side via the admin user list since the audit response only carries the id. New "Audit Log" entry in the Administration nav group. The endpoint is not in the generated SDK yet, so `src/lib/api/audit.ts` uses the shared `apiFetch` wrapper with zod validation at the trust boundary (same pattern as rate-limits); on a backend without the endpoint the page degrades to an "unavailable" alert.
- **SSO admin UI: surface the SAML `use_absolute_acs_url` opt-in** (#521) - backfills the per-provider toggle the backend added (migration 139) but the admin UI never surfaced (the "lockstep debt"). The SAML provider form gains a **Use absolute ACS URL** switch in the Sign Requests / Require Signed Assertions group, for stricter SAML 2.0 IdPs that reject relative AssertionConsumerServiceURLs (e.g. Lark AnyCross). Off by default (pre-138 wire format), sourced from the loaded config, and echoed on create + update. `src/types/sso.ts` and the `adaptSamlConfig` adapter propagate the field with a defensive `false` default so the UI is safe to deploy against a backend that predates the column. (The sibling OIDC `allow_legacy_rsa_keys` toggle, #522, is deferred to v1.4.0 to stay in lockstep with its still-open backend PR.)
- **`release/1.1.x` maintenance branch + `:1.1-dev` Docker tag rule** (#331) - mirrors `artifact-keeper#890`; pushes to `release/1.1.x` now publish `ghcr.io/artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper-web:1.1-dev` so the v1.1.x release-gate can test a true v1.1.x web/backend pair.

### Changed
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to sso (final batch)** (#359 batch 9) - replaced all 30 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/sso.ts` with adapter functions and `assertData` guards. 7 read adapters (SsoProvider / OidcConfig / LdapConfig / SamlConfig / LdapTestResult / TokenPair) and 6 write adapters covering the OIDC/LDAP/SAML create+update request shapes. Provider type narrowed via `narrowEnum` to the local `oidc | ldap | saml` union. The SDK declares attribute_mapping values as `unknown` while the local types declare them as string; the adapter coerces non-strings defensively. `ldapLogin` runtime-narrows the SDK's `unknown` 200 response to extract the access/refresh token pair. Closes #359 in full.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to security** (#359 batch 8) - replaced all 25 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/security.ts` with adapter functions and `assertData` guards. 9 read adapters (Dashboard / Score / Scan / ScanList / Finding / FindingList / Policy / ScanConfig / RepoSecurity / TriggerScanResponse) and 4 write adapters (TriggerRequest / CreatePolicyRequest / UpdatePolicyRequest / UpsertScanConfigRequest). The Score adapter synthesizes `total_findings` from severity counts since the SDK ScoreResponse doesn't expose it directly. SDK PolicyResponse has additional fields the local ScanPolicy doesn't model (`max_artifact_age_days`, `min_staging_hours`, `require_signature`) which the adapter intentionally drops — those are consumed by the lifecycle module, not security.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to promotion** (#359 batch 7) - replaced 9 of 10 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/promotion.ts` with adapter functions, `assertData` guards, and `narrowEnum` for `severity` (`critical`/`high`/`medium`/`low`/`info`) and `PromotionHistoryStatus` (`promoted`/`rejected`/`pending_approval`). One `as unknown as` retained inline for `policy_result` (the SDK exposes the field as an opaque key/value bag, the local type declares a typed `PolicyEvaluationResult` that consumers only access lazily — bridge documented). Also exports `adaptArtifact` / `adaptArtifactList` from `artifacts.ts` and `adaptRepository` / `adaptRepositoryList` from `repositories.ts` so promotion can reuse them rather than re-implementing.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to dependency-track** (#359 batch 6) - replaced all 12 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/dependency-track.ts` with adapter functions and `assertData` guards. The SDK declares every metric counter on `DtProjectMetrics` / `DtPortfolioMetrics` as optional; the local types declare them as required `: number`. Adapters coerce undefined → 0 so an empty backend response renders numeric zeros in the metrics card instead of "undefined". Nested adapters for `DtFinding` (component / vulnerability / analysis / attribution / cwe / license) preserve existing render behavior.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to sbom** (#359 batch 5) - replaced all 21 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/sbom.ts` with adapter functions, `assertData` guards, and exported `narrowCveStatus` / `narrowPolicyAction` helpers for callers that want a typed status. Multiple SDK shape mismatches are now explicit and documented: `LicenseCheckResult` is synthesized (SDK returns `violations: string[]` with no `action`; adapter coerces to `{license, reason}` rows and derives `action: "block"|"allow"` from `compliant`); `getByArtifact` no longer accepts a `format` query param (the SDK has no query and the backend ignored it pre-#359). No app consumer surfaces these endpoints today, so the synthesis is best-effort and documented inline. Other endpoints (generate/list/get/getComponents/convert/getCveHistory/updateCveStatus/getCveTrends/list-get-upsert-deletePolicy) round-trip pages unchanged.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to replication** (#359 batch 4) - replaced all 11 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/replication.ts` with adapter functions, `assertData` guards, and `narrowEnum` for the `PeerStatus` union. Dropped three dead fields from `PeerInstance` (`api_key`/`sync_filter`/`updated_at`) and one from `PeerConnection` (`source_peer_id`) — all four were declared on the local types but never populated by the SDK and never read by any consumer (verified via grep). The peers list and connections table render unchanged.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to telemetry** (#359 batch 3) - replaced all 9 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/telemetry.ts` with adapter functions, `assertData` guards, and explicit body forwarding. CrashReport's optional+nullable fields (`stack_trace`, `os_info`, `uptime_seconds`, `submitted_at`, `submission_error`) now normalize undefined → null. Pages that consume this API are unchanged.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to webhooks + analytics** (#359 batch 2) - replaced all 9 `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/webhooks.ts` and all 11 in `src/lib/api/analytics.ts` with adapter functions, `assertData` guards, and `narrowEnum` for the `WebhookEvent` string-to-union narrowing. Webhook events that the web doesn't model yet now fall back to `artifact_uploaded` with a console warning instead of crashing render code expecting a known event. Pages that consume these APIs are unchanged.
- **Type-safe API layer — extend #206 hardening to monitoring + lifecycle** (#359 batch 1) - replaced all `as never` casts in `src/lib/api/monitoring.ts` and `src/lib/api/lifecycle.ts` with adapter functions and `assertData` guards. Adapters normalize the SDK's `?: string | null` (optional + nullable) shape to the local types' `: string | null` (required + nullable) shape so callers see a stable contract. Two `as unknown as` casts remain in `lifecycle.ts` and are commented inline: the SDK incorrectly types `createLifecyclePolicy` / `updateLifecyclePolicy` bodies as the security-policy request shape rather than the lifecycle request shape — to be removed when the generator is rebuilt against the corrected OpenAPI spec. Pages that consume these APIs are unchanged.
- **Admin Settings page now issues one HTTP call instead of three** (#349) - the page used to call `/api/v1/admin/settings` three times via separate `useQuery` hooks (one each for `password-policy`, `storage-settings`, `smtp-config`). Replaced with a single `admin-settings` query backed by new `settingsApi.getAllSettings()` and the `useAdminSettings()` hook. The SMTP tab consumes the same hook so react-query dedups it. Public per-getter API (`getPasswordPolicy` / `getStorageSettings` / `getSmtpConfig`) preserved for non-page consumers (e.g. the inline `PasswordPolicyHint`). Cuts settings page network round trips by 67%. **Behavioral note**: with one shared query, a malformed slice of the response (e.g. bad SMTP fields) now fails the whole bundle — Storage and Password Policy rows show "Unavailable" alongside the SMTP error, even though their fields parsed fine. Pre-PR these would have parsed independently. The trade-off is acceptable because all three slices come from the same endpoint and a malformed bundle is almost always a backend-wide problem; per-slice fault isolation is filed as a follow-up.
- **`toUserMessage` truncates user-untrusted error text at 240 chars** (#356) - prevents a 50KB stack trace or HTML 500 page from rendering as a wall of text in a toast. Truncated output is suffixed with `… [truncated, <n> more chars]` so it's clear the message was clipped. Author-controlled fallback strings are not truncated.
- **`toUserMessage` prefixes fallback with HTTP status code** (#355) - when an error carries an HTTP status (`.status` / `.statusCode` / `.body.status`) but the body has no useful message, the fallback now reads "(HTTP 409) Failed to create permission" instead of just "Failed to create permission" so a 409 Conflict differentiates from a 500 Internal Server Error in toast text. Backend-provided messages stay unchanged (no double-decoration). Closes the deferred half of #207.
- **Extract `mutationErrorToast` helper to deduplicate ~125 mutation `onError` callsites** (#354) - the pattern `onError: (err) => toast.error(toUserMessage(err, "Failed to <action>"))` was repeated across most pages; collapsed to `onError: mutationErrorToast("Failed to <action>")` in 36 files (-145 LOC). Centralizes future tweaks (HTTP status prefix, truncation, telemetry) to one place. User-visible toast strings are unchanged.
- **Type-safe API layer — replace double-casts with adapters and zod** (#206) - removed all `as unknown as T` and `as never` casts in 15 of `src/lib/api/*.ts` files. Each SDK call now goes through an adapter function or a Set-backed narrowing helper that warns on unknown enum values. `assertData` (new in `fetch.ts`) rejects empty body responses with a contextual error. `settings.ts` uses zod `.safeParse()` at the trust boundary for `getPasswordPolicy`/`getSmtpConfig`. Public `xxxApi` return types unchanged so consumer code is untouched.

### Fixed
- **Every assigned repository on the Replication Subscriptions tab read "Pull", whatever mode was stored** (#817, backend artifact-keeper#3575) - the per-repository **Replication Mode** dropdown had nothing to render from: `GET /api/v1/peers/{id}/repositories` returned a bare array of repository ids, so the page fell back to `assignedSet.has(r.id) ? "pull" : "none"` and displayed `pull` for `push` and `mirror` subscriptions alike. Since that dropdown is also the editing control, a confident wrong reading was one save away from becoming the stored value. The tab now reads `replication_mode` off the subscription list the endpoint returns after backend artifact-keeper#3575, and the column header gains a tooltip stating that direction is relative to this instance (push = this instance sends to the peer), which the UI stated nowhere before. **Requires a backend carrying artifact-keeper#3575**: against an older backend the endpoint still returns bare ids, and the tab reads every repository as unassigned with mode `None` rather than showing a wrong direction. The generated SDK still types the response as `string[]`, so `peersApi.getRepositories` reads the subscription shape through a passthrough cast until the SDK is regenerated, matching how `admin.ts` handles the health `image_tag`. `DataTableColumn.header` widens from `string` to `ReactNode` to carry the tooltip.
- **Downloads read `0` for every artifact in a proxy repository, whether or not anything was measured** (#808, backend artifact-keeper#3388 / artifact-keeper#3446) - the artifact browser rendered `download_count` verbatim, which was the honest thing to do while the backend hardcoded `0` for every proxy-cached row, but stops being honest from 1.8.0: backend artifact-keeper#3388 now returns a real count for cached rows, and only some formats produce one. Downloads served from the proxy cache are recorded for **PyPI, npm, Maven, Ansible, Conda, CRAN, RPM and RubyGems**; the other ~19 remote-capable formats — Docker/OCI, cargo, NuGet, Debian, Helm, Go, Composer, Conan and the rest — record nothing at all (artifact-keeper#3446), so their counter sits at `0` no matter how much traffic the proxy serves. Both cases rendered as the same `0`, which reads as "nothing is using this proxy" and is exactly the reading that gets a busy repository deleted. On a Remote repository whose format records nothing, the Downloads cell now shows a dash with a hover explanation ("This format does not record downloads served from the proxy cache yet … It is not a measured zero") plus screen-reader text, and the artifact detail dialog says **Not tracked** instead of `0`; a format that does record still shows its real `0`, so a measured zero and an unmeasured one are no longer the same glyph. **A non-zero count always renders as the number**, whichever list says what — a count that exists is proof the format is instrumented, so this can never hide real data behind a dash and a format the backend starts counting mid-release surfaces its traffic without waiting for a web release. **Trade-offs:** the backend publishes no capability field for this today, so the boundary is a format list in the frontend (`src/lib/proxy-downloads.ts`) that has to be trimmed as artifact-keeper#3446 lands formats — it is consulted only for a *zero*, and it reads an API-reported `records_proxy_downloads` capability off `GET /api/v1/formats` first, so the day the backend states this per handler the hardcoded list stops being consulted with no further change here. The list is deliberately conservative: format ids that only resemble an instrumented handler (`gradle`, `yarn`, `pnpm`, `poetry`, `conda_native`) are left out, since claiming "not tracked" on an idle repository is a smaller error than showing a confident `0` for a busy one. The Packages tab's own Downloads column and the RAW folder-tree badge are untouched (the tree already renders nothing at zero rather than asserting a count).
- **The UI reported the wrong version: web 1.8.0 displayed itself as "Web 1.7.0"** (#784) - `package.json` was not bumped for the 1.8.0 release, so the published 1.8.0 image advertised the previous version everywhere the app names itself: the sidebar's Web/Server pair, the admin Settings page, and `GET /api/version`. Confirmed against the published image rather than inferred -- the client bundle in `ghcr.io/artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper-web:1.8.0` carries the literal `"1.7.0"` at the sidebar render site, and contains no occurrence of `1.8.0` at all. The displayed version is what a user quotes in a bug report and what an operator checks to decide whether a fix landed, so everything shipped in 1.8.0 could be diagnosed as missing and send the investigation to the wrong changelog. Note the `APP_VERSION` build arg did **not** mask this and cannot: CI passes `APP_VERSION=v1.8.0` from the git tag into `ENV NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION`, but `next.config.ts` sets the same variable to `pkg.version` literally and that explicit config value wins, so `package.json` is the sole source of the displayed version regardless of how the image is built. `package.json` (and the two matching `package-lock.json` entries) now read 1.8.0, and `scripts/assert-version-matches-tag.sh` is wired into both `docker-publish.yml` and `release.yml` so a tag whose `package.json` disagrees fails before an image is published or a Release is created. The trade-off: the gate runs at tag time, so it stops a mismatched release rather than preventing the mismatch from reaching `main` -- catching it earlier would mean deciding on `main` what the next version is, which this repo deliberately does not do.
- **Visual regression CI now compares against baselines instead of silently rewriting them** (#781) - the `E2E Visual Regression` job ran the suite with `--update-snapshots`, which overwrites each baseline with whatever the page currently renders rather than comparing, so the job reported success no matter what changed and caught zero regressions. Compounding it, all 31 committed baselines were `*-darwin.png` while CI runs on `ubuntu-latest` and looks for `*-linux.png`, so even without the flag the job would have generated every baseline from scratch on each run. The CI invocation now drops `--update-snapshots` and genuinely compares; the 31 baselines are regenerated as Linux images (captured on the same `ubuntu-latest` runner CI uses, so font rendering matches) and committed, and the unverified darwin baselines are removed with a `.gitignore` rule preventing wrong-platform images from re-entering. Baseline refresh moves to a manually dispatched **Update Visual Baselines** workflow that regenerates and commits the Linux baselines back to the branch under review — so an intentional UI change updates them deliberately, with the image diff visible in the commit, instead of every build erasing the evidence. Since these baselines were never actually compared before, the first comparing run may surface genuine pre-existing visual issues.
- **Local admin credentials form now appears under SSO when the operator allowed it** (#615, backend artifact-keeper#2621/#2729) - with an OIDC or SAML provider configured and no LDAP, the login page hid the username/password form unconditionally. Operators who had enabled `ALLOW_LOCAL_ADMIN_LOGIN` for break-glass access were left with nothing to type into, and `/login?fallback=local` was the only way to get the form back. That check was a stopgap heuristic (no LDAP + a redirect provider exists means the fields have no consumer) written before the backend published the real policy. The page now reads `auth.local_login_enabled` from `GET /api/v1/system/config`, which is the backend's own answer to whether the form should be offered: true when no SSO provider is enabled, and under SSO only when the operator set `ALLOW_LOCAL_ADMIN_LOGIN` without setting `SSO_DISABLE_ADMIN_BREAK_GLASS`. The flag is deliberately narrower than the login endpoint's gate, since a verified admin keeps a break-glass password path by default (backend #443) that is not advertised, so `?fallback=local` stays on as the supported admin recovery route rather than as a leftover. LDAP is unaffected: an enabled LDAP provider still shows the form regardless of the flag, as does first-time setup. Backends predating the flag omit the field, so `parseSystemConfig` defaults it to `true` rather than hiding the only form those deployments have. The form decision now also waits on the system config query in addition to the SSO provider list, so no form flashes and disappears on load, and `?fallback=local` bypasses that wait so a hung request cannot strand the page on a spinner.
- **Public system config no longer fails to parse for unauthenticated callers** (#615, backend artifact-keeper#1960) - `parseSystemConfig` required `scanners`, `search_engine`, `storage_backend` and `permissions`, but the backend made all four admin-only: they are omitted from the response entirely for anonymous and non-admin callers so the instance's security posture cannot be fingerprinted. Every anonymous fetch of `GET /api/v1/system/config` therefore threw, the query failed, and consumers silently fell back to `DEFAULT_SYSTEM_CONFIG`. The login page is by definition an anonymous caller, so it never saw a real config at all and could not have honored `auth.local_login_enabled`. The four fields now fall back to their documented defaults when absent, so the public-safe half of the payload (auth providers, upload limit, guest access, demo mode) parses and reaches the UI. The request also carries a 10 second timeout: `apiFetch` sets none, and the login page blocks its form decision on this query, so a request that hung rather than failed showed a permanent spinner.
- **A long artifact filename pushed the artifact table off the detail panel, out of reach** (#768) - a single artifact whose filename was long enough widened the flat artifact table past the repository detail panel, and the overflow could not be scrolled to: Size, Downloads, Created and the per-row Details/Download actions were clipped with no horizontal scrollbar, and wheel/trackpad/keyboard reached nothing. Name was the only wide column with no width constraint — Path beside it was already capped with `max-w-[200px] truncate` — and since both table primitives force `whitespace-nowrap`, nothing wrapped and the column took the full rendered width of the longest filename on the page. That width then escaped the table: the panel's `ScrollArea` viewport sizes its content with `display: table` (shrink-to-fit, floored at 100%) and Radix derives the viewport's overflow from the scrollbars that mount, so with only a vertical `ScrollBar` rendered it is permanently `overflow-x: hidden`. The excess therefore applied to the whole detail column — also displacing right-aligned controls in the cards above the table, such as the Storage card's "Estimate" button — and was then clipped. The name cell is now capped and elided in the **middle** rather than the end, via a new `MiddleEllipsis` component: artifact names are distinguished by their tail as often as their head (`…-tlsconsul` vs `…-tlsconsul-docker`, version and variant suffixes, file extensions), so end-truncation would have rendered such rows visually identical. CSS `text-overflow` can only elide the end, so the value is split into a head that shrinks and truncates and a tail pinned with `shrink-0`, keeping the result width-responsive rather than guessing character counts against a container whose width is unknown until layout. The full name stays available via the native tooltip and the detail dialog, and the DOM text content stays complete so the name remains selectable, copyable, and correctly announced by screen readers. Affects every format that renders the flat table (generic, npm, and the rest); maven/gradle/docker default to grouped card views that already truncate. Note that the underlying `overflow-x: hidden` trap remains at every `ScrollArea` call site — this removes the input that was tripping it, not the trap.
- **Artifact list pagination reported a total that grew with the page number** (#767) - the pagination bar under a repository's artifact list read `1-20 of 21` on page 1, `21-40 of 41` on page 2 and `41-60 of 61` on page 3, whatever the repository actually held, with an equally incoherent `Page 1 of 2` / `Page 2 of 3` beside it. The arithmetic in `DataTablePagination` was sound; the number handed to it was never a total. The keyset-paged listings (backend artifact-keeper#2520 / #2519 / #2518) deliberately avoid a whole-catalog `COUNT` on every page request, so `pagination.total` defaults to a cheap lower bound — `offset + rows + has_more` — with `has_more` as the authoritative next-page signal, and exact counts opt-in through `?count=exact`, which the web client never sent. Because the bar derives **both** the range label and `totalPages` from `total`, that single lower-bound value produced both symptoms. `ListArtifactsParams` gains `count?: 'exact'`, forwarded in `buildArtifactsListPath` (`listGrouped` builds its query string by hand, since the SDK models no `group_by`, and silently dropped the new param until it was threaded through), and the repository-content query now opts in. No backend change was required — `?count=exact` already exists and is honoured on every branch of the handler (flat hosted, virtual, remote-cached, `group_by=maven_component` for hosted and remote, `group_by=docker_tag`). One query feeds the flat table, the Maven component list and the Docker tag list, so all three views are fixed together. This costs one extra `COUNT` query per page load, which is precisely what artifact-keeper#2520 set out to avoid; accepted here because this surface renders a total *and* a page count, so it genuinely needs a real one. Listings that only need "is there a next page" should keep `count` unset and read `has_more`.
- **npm virtual repositories can be created again; npm remotes no longer silently block unscoped packages** (#745) - the create dialog offered the npm scope-policy section for `virtual` repositories and always attached `npm_allowed_scopes` / `npm_allowed_name_patterns` / `npm_allow_unscoped` to the request, even when the operator never touched it. The backend gate is *presence*-based (`[]` deserializes to `Some([])`, `false` to `Some(false)`), so **every** npm virtual create failed with `Validation error: npm scope policy is only configurable on remote (proxy) repositories` and no repository was created. The policy is stored on and read from each Remote *member* — the npm virtual resolver consults the member's policy during candidate selection (backend artifact-keeper#2327/#2424) — so `hasNpmScopePolicy` now returns true only for npm **remote**, and the misleading comment claiming both types qualify is corrected. Second, worse half: a stored `allow_unscoped: false` makes the policy `is_active()`, and an active policy denies every unscoped name, so creating an npm **proxy** through the UI with the section untouched silently blocked bare package names (`react`, `lodash`, `express`) despite the form's own "Empty leaves the repository unrestricted by scope" hint. Create-time submission is now gated on a new `hasNpmScopePolicyInput` predicate, so an untouched section sends nothing and the backend's allow-all default stands. `buildNpmScopePolicyFields` still emits every key unconditionally — that is what lets the settings tab *clear* a stored allow-list, and the settings tab keeps its own "changed vs stored" gate.
- **OIDC claim config keys now match the backend's `<field>_claim` schema** (#516) - the OIDC provider form wrote its claim overrides to `attribute_mapping` under the bare keys `username` / `email` / `groups` (plus `display_name`), but the backend (`sso.rs::resolve_oidc_claim_name`) only reads `username_claim` / `email_claim` / `groups_claim`, so every configured OIDC claim override was silently ignored — logins fell back to the built-in defaults regardless of what the operator typed. `handleSubmit` now writes the `_claim`-suffixed keys (`display_name_claim` too, for parity, though the backend does not consume it yet) and drops the legacy bare keys from the JSONB blob on save. The edit dialog reads the new keys with a fallback to the legacy keys so a provider saved by the pre-fix UI still displays its configured claim names. Unrelated `attribute_mapping` keys still round-trip (regression #406 preserved).
- **Extend SSE EVENT_TYPE_MAP to webhook/artifact/scan/backup/plugin events** (#213) - the per-domain map only covered 7 domains (users, groups, repositories, service accounts, permissions, quality gates, dashboard). When backend events fired for the missing domains over SSE, the UI didn't refetch stale data — operators had to hard-refresh. Adds 5 QUERY_KEYS (`WEBHOOKS`, `WEBHOOK_DELIVERIES`, `BACKUPS`, `SECURITY`, `PLUGINS`), 4 INVALIDATION_GROUPS (`webhooks`, `backups`, `security`, `plugins`), and 19 new event-type entries (`webhook.{created,updated,deleted,delivery}`, `artifact.{uploaded,deleted}`, `scan.{started,completed,failed}`, `finding.{acknowledged,acknowledgment_revoked}`, `backup.{created,completed,failed,restored}`, `plugin.{installed,uninstalled,enabled,disabled}`). Map size grew 20 → 39.
- **Setup Guide: sanitize repo keys for Gradle/SBT property names + clearer SSR placeholder** (#362, partial) - the Gradle credentials snippet emitted property names like `my-jvm-repoUsername` for hyphenated repo keys; technically legal in `gradle.properties` but looks broken to readers expecting identifier rules. Added a `repoKeyToGradleId` helper that camelCases kebab/dot/underscore separators and strips remaining non-alphanumerics. URLs and `<id>` slots keep the raw key — only property names sanitize. Also replaced the SSR fallback `https://artifacts.example.com` with `__REPLACE_WITH_REGISTRY_URL__` so prerendered HTML doesn't ship with a real-looking domain a user could accidentally copy. Remaining `repo_type` (proxy/virtual hides publish steps) and `is_public` (anonymous mode) fixes deferred to follow-up.
- **Per-artifact Security tab now surfaces native scan_findings** (#368) - the Security tab on the repository view (`security-tab-content.tsx`) used to show only SBOM CVE history and Dependency-Track findings, never the native `scan_findings` table. A user who triggered a scan via `POST /api/v1/security/scan` for a specific artifact had no way to see the resulting findings on the artifact's own page — they had to navigate to `/security/scans` and find the right scan ID by name+timestamp. New `ArtifactScansSection` component lists recent scan_results rows for the artifact (status / type / counts / completed_at) with a "View findings" link to the per-scan page. Sourced from `securityApi.listArtifactScans(artifact.id)` which already existed but had no consumer.
- **`getInstallCommand` returns Gradle/SBT-native snippets instead of Maven XML** (#361) - the JVM case in `package-utils.ts` returned the same `<dependency>` XML for all three of `maven` / `gradle` / `sbt`. Users browsing a Gradle-named repo saw Maven XML in the package detail / copy-snippet UI — same bug class #333 fixed on the Setup Guide page. Now `gradle` returns `implementation 'GROUP:name:version'` and `sbt` returns `libraryDependencies += "GROUP" % "name" % "version"`. Maven output is unchanged.
- **Surface load failures in `getPasswordPolicy` and `getSmtpConfig` instead of silently falling back to defaults** (#347) - both getters previously caught any SDK error or schema mismatch and returned baked-in defaults, so a backend outage rendered as plausible-looking placeholder values on the admin Settings page (same failure mode as #334). Now the getters throw on SDK error / unparseable response, and the page renders explicit "Unavailable" states (Password Policy row + SMTP tab error alert) so an operator can tell something's actually wrong.
- **`formatBytes` returns "--" for NaN/Infinity/negative input** (#348) - previously these inputs produced nonsense strings like "NaN undefined" or "Infinity undefined" visible on the admin Settings → Storage tab. Now returns the same `--` sentinel already used elsewhere in the package/search rendering paths. Also clamps the unit index for >TB values so multi-PB byte counts render as "<n> TB" rather than indexing past the units table.
- **SSO login button reads "Sign in with SSO" instead of generic provider names like "default"** (#351) - when an admin's SSO provider is named `default` / `primary` / `main` / `sso` (or empty/whitespace), the button now falls back to a protocol-aware label (`Sign in with SSO (OIDC)` / `(SAML)`) so users see what they're actually clicking. Real provider names like "Corp SSO" are preserved unchanged.
- **Login page hides username/password fields when only redirect SSO is configured** (#350) - previously the form rendered even when the only available auth method was OIDC/SAML, leaving the fields with no consumer. The form now hides when SSO providers exist and no LDAP provider is configured. Setup mode and the `?fallback=local` query param keep the form available for first-time setup and operator recovery. A loading skeleton during the SSO providers fetch prevents the form from briefly flashing visible. Heuristic stopgap until the backend exposes a public `local_auth_enabled` flag.
- **Migration Add Connection now lets users pick the source repository manager type** (#319) - the form previously had no Source Type field, so the backend silently defaulted every connection to Artifactory. Adds a Source Type Select with Artifactory + Nexus options (the two values the SDK currently accepts), threaded through types, the API adapter, the form state, and the create-connection mutation body. Default remains Artifactory to preserve prior behavior.
- **Setup Guide now shows correct client snippets for Gradle and SBT repos** (#333) - JVM-format repos (maven / gradle / sbt) previously rendered only Maven `pom.xml` / `settings.xml`. The dialog now offers Maven, Gradle (Groovy), Gradle (Kotlin), and SBT tabs with the correct credential and dependency snippets per client. Default tab tracks the repo's declared format so a Gradle repo opens on Gradle (Groovy).
- **Mutation errors now surface backend details instead of generic placeholders** (#207) - audited every TanStack Query `useMutation` and replaced opaque `onError: () => toast.error("Failed to ...")` callbacks with `toUserMessage(err, fallback)`-driven toasts. 91 callsites across 27 files. Also adds `onError` to 8 previously-silent mutations (security/policies/scans + repo-selector preview), and disambiguates the SSO toggle toasts per provider (OIDC/LDAP/SAML). `toUserMessage` now also reads FastAPI-style `.detail` fields so plugin-install errors (and any other FastAPI-shaped backend error) surface their server-side message.

### Accessibility
- **Aria attribute coverage on admin pages** (#208) - replaced `title` with `aria-label` on icon-only buttons (lifecycle, monitoring, quality-gates, sso, telemetry, groups, security/scans, file-viewer); paired form inputs with labels via `htmlFor`/`id`; added accessible names to `Switch` components. Per-row table action buttons (SSO providers, quality gates, lifecycle policies, telemetry crash reports, users, monitoring suppress) now interpolate the row's identifying name into the aria-label so screen readers can disambiguate. Newly accessible-named `Refresh` buttons on approvals, security, and migration pages.

### Security
- **Build provenance is no longer allowed to fail silently in `docker-publish`** (#815) - the `Generate artifact attestation` step carried a bare `continue-on-error: true`, so if attaching provenance to the published multi-arch image had ever failed, the step would have turned yellow while the `Multi-Arch Manifest` job still reported `success` -- `needs.merge.result` green, nothing annotated, and the image live on ghcr.io and Docker Hub with no provenance. That is the shape of the regression that shipped backend 1.6.1 unsigned (artifact-keeper#2824). Verified before removing it: the step has never actually failed (`success` in all 99 of the last 100 runs that reached the job), the job already grants `id-token: write` and `attestations: write`, and the digest currently behind `:dev` does carry an attestation -- so this was a disarmed alarm rather than a live gap, and no web image has shipped without provenance. The soft-fail is now gone and an attestation failure fails the publish job.
- **Pin third-party GitHub Actions to commit SHAs** (#205) - every third-party `uses:` line in `codeql.yml`, `dependency-review.yml`, `docker-publish.yml`, and `stale.yml` is now pinned to a specific commit SHA (with a version comment) so an upstream tag rewrite cannot silently swap action code. `ci.yml` was already pinned and is the model. The same-org reusable workflow `artifact-keeper/artifact-keeper-test/.github/workflows/release-gate.yml@main` (docker-publish.yml line 191) is intentionally tracked on `main` — same-org workflows inherit the org's branch-protection trust boundary, and pinning a reusable workflow to a SHA is operationally heavier. Dependabot is configured for `github-actions`, so bumps continue to flow through review.

### Notes
- **v1.1.8 web image is permanently unavailable** (#320) - the web release process stopped at v1.1.3 while the backend continued through v1.1.8. There is no v1.1.8 source ref to rebuild from; backfilling would falsify provenance. See [docs/release-history/v1.1.8-web-postmortem.md](docs/release-history/v1.1.8-web-postmortem.md). Recurrence is prevented by `artifact-keeper#882` (image-publish gate).

## [1.8.0] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed
- **Repository dialogs: private-by-default + public toggle hidden when guest access is off** (#734) - the create-repository form initialized `is_public: true`, overriding the backend's private-by-default posture, and both dialogs showed an enabled Public switch even when the backend runs with `AK_GUEST_ACCESS_ENABLED=false` (anonymous access impossible; the backend coerces `is_public=true` to false anyway). The create form now defaults to private, and when `/api/v1/system/config` reports `guest_access_enabled: false` the switch is replaced with a muted "Public repositories are disabled by the operator." note in both create and edit dialogs. Reads the flag via the existing `SystemConfigProvider`/`useFeatureFlags`; while the config loads, the switch renders (the backend coercion makes that the safe direction).

## [1.7.0] - 2026-08-01

Surfaces the Artifact Keeper 1.7.0 backend capabilities in the web UI, on `@artifact-keeper/sdk` 1.7.0. Highlights: reversible age-gate review decisions and per-repo age-gate settings, quarantine release/reject from the artifact browser, a curation Rules editor for publisher-trust and popularity gates, per-repo scanning & enforcement settings, SIEM-ready NDJSON audit export, and WASM plugin layout selection — plus a security-hardening round (nonce-based CSP, runtime HTTPS enforcement, CSRF defense-in-depth) and an accessibility round (page titles, skip navigation, axe scanning in CI).

### Thank You

- **[@dvodop](https://github.com/dvodop)** — package age policy state persists across navigation (#657) and a scrollable create-repository dialog (#652)
- **[@ivolnistov](https://github.com/ivolnistov)** — repository scope selector for lifecycle policies (#660) and service-account principals in the permissions UI (#710)
- **[@nicola-preda](https://github.com/nicola-preda)** — repository picker in the security policy form (#662) and connector-type labels on migration test-connection toasts (#625)

### Added

- **Age-gate review decisions can be changed after the fact** — the queue's status is now a dropdown backed by the backend reopen endpoint: reopen-to-pending re-applies the gate and withholds the version again, reopen-then-decide runs as one operator action with an explicit halfway-state error if the second call fails, reopen requires a non-blank reason, and approving confirms against the version being released. The queue also surfaces the decision metadata it was already receiving (recorded reason, deciding admin, decision date) and moves status filtering to multi-status checkboxes. The reopen capability is detected per-session rather than version-checked, so a backend that predates the endpoint degrades to decide-only with an explanation (#651, #698; backend artifact-keeper#2939).
- **Per-repo age-gate settings panel and webhook event wiring** (#701, #707).
- **Quarantine release and reject from the artifact detail dialog** — admins can lift or finalize a quarantine hold from the repository artifact browser (reject takes an optional reason; both hidden for non-admins). The artifacts listing now carries the backend's per-row quarantine state (`is_blocked`, `quarantine_status`, `quarantine_until`, `quarantine_reason` — absent, not null, where the server did not look), the previously unreachable `QuarantineBanner` is finally live, and a blocked artifact's download control is disabled and relabelled with the reason instead of clicking through to a 409 (#650, backend artifact-keeper#2940).
- **Curation Rules editor** — author publisher-trust and popularity/typo-squat gates from a Rules tab alongside the existing review queue (#683).
- **Scanning & enforcement settings panel** — per-repo scan toggles (`scan_enabled`, `scan_on_upload`, `scan_on_proxy`), inline scan-and-block, severity threshold, and a fail-open vs fail-closed proxy scan action (#681).
- **SIEM audit-log export** — NDJSON export of the admin audit log in the backend's published audit-event v1 schema (one self-contained record per line), alongside the CSV and versioned-JSON formats (#703, #706).
- **npm upstream feed configuration UI** (#702, #705).
- **WASM plugin layouts selectable and displayed in the UI** (#591, #592, #709) — full layout display requires backend artifact-keeper#3070 (backend 1.7.0 line).
- **Service-account principals in the permissions UI** (#710).
- **Read-only UI for SSO-synced groups** — edit and add-member actions are disabled on externally synced groups (#629, #711).
- **Repository scope selector for lifecycle policies** (#660).
- **Repository detail defaults to the Packages tab** for package-oriented formats; RAW/Generic and container/OCI formats keep the Artifacts tab (#633).
- **Accessibility: page titles, skip-navigation link, and axe-core scanning in CI**, including accessible names for the repository list filter selects (#671, #687).

### Changed

- Consume **`@artifact-keeper/sdk` 1.7.0** (#667); SDK client refactor adds an `unwrap` helper, removes dead API modules, and standardizes named exports (#678, #694). `apiFetch` now throws an exported `ApiError` carrying `.status` and the raw `.body` (additive, backward compatible) (#651).
- **Docker tag view uses server-side `docker_tag` grouping** — true multi-arch-aware image sizes, scan rollup status, and server-side pagination, fixing the empty "No image tags found" state on large registries (#561, #714).
- **Repository-list queries consolidated into shared hooks** (#669, #692).
- **Combined dependency bump** superseding 12 dependabot PRs (#704).
- **Storage reclaim estimate** — the panel's reclaim dry-run now uses the shipped per-repo `storage-gc` endpoint instead of 404ing (#708, #716); the estimate requires backend artifact-keeper#3074 (backend 1.7.0 line).

### Fixed

- **Staging release target is read back and honored** — the Settings picker shows the saved link instead of always "None", and the Promote dialog locks to the linked target with a "Linked release target" badge (#658, #661, #712).
- **Users list and group member picker paginated** (#564, #715).
- **Package age policy state persists across navigation** — the form now seeds from the saved server state instead of hardcoded defaults (#656, #657).
- **Quarantine listing badges aligned with the shipped backend contract** (#697, #700).
- **Silent `per_page` truncation surfaced on admin list pages** (#670, #688).
- **Security Policies form: choose a repository instead of typing its UUID** (#489, #662).
- **Scrollable create repository dialog** (#652).
- **Migration test-connection toast labeled by connector type** (#625).
- **Accessibility: nested interactive elements removed from repository list rows** (#672, #689).

### Security

- **Nonce-based CSP without `script-src unsafe-inline`** (#674, #693).
- **`AK_ENFORCE_HTTPS` evaluated at runtime** instead of build time (#679, #691).
- **Custom header on mutations for CSRF defense-in-depth** (#673, #690).
- **CI dependency gates** — dependency review is now blocking and an npm audit gate was added (#675, #686).

### Removed

- **SMTP save flow** — the backend has never exposed an SMTP save endpoint (SMTP is configured exclusively via server environment variables), so the Email tab's always-404ing editable form is replaced with an informational notice pointing at the env vars; Send Test Email remains (#555, #713).

## [1.6.0] - 2026-07-31

Surfaces the Artifact Keeper 1.6.0 backend capabilities in the web UI (epic #599), on `@artifact-keeper/sdk` 1.6.0. Highlights: audit-log SIEM export, per-folder deduplicated storage usage, CVE blast-radius latent-exposure disclosure, 1.6.0 format-specific repository config, the age-gate review queue, and a browseable folder tree for RAW/Generic repositories — plus authorization hardening and a round of admin-UI fixes.

## [1.1.0-rc.3] - 2026-02-17

### Fixed
- **`BACKEND_URL` ignored at runtime in standalone Docker** (#56, #58) — replaced build-time `rewrites()` with a Next.js middleware that reads `BACKEND_URL` on each request, so containers can be configured without rebuilding
- **Non-admin users saw admin scope checkbox** (#57) — the "Admin" scope option is now hidden in both API Keys and Access Tokens forms for non-admin users

### Added
- **Token CRUD E2E tests** (#57) — Playwright tests for `POST /api/v1/auth/tokens` (create), `DELETE /api/v1/auth/tokens/:id` (revoke), and empty-name validation

### Changed
- Extracted `TokenCreateForm` component to eliminate duplicated form blocks in the profile page (#57)
- Removed `ARG BACKEND_URL` from Dockerfile build stage; default is now a runtime `ENV` (#58)
